                <strong>Orchestrator</strong> is a MySQL replication topology management and visualization tool, allowing for: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Detection and investigation of replication clusters</li>
                    <li>Safe topology refactoring: moving slaves around the topology</li>
                    <li>Sleek topology visualization</li>
                    <li>Replication problems visualization</li>
                    <li>Topology changes via intuitive drag & drop</li>
                    <li>Maintenance mode declaration and enforcement</li>
                    <li>Auditing of operations</li>
                    <li>More...</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Refactoring the topology is a matter of a simple drag & drop. <i>Orchestrator</i> will keep you
                safe by disallowing invalid replication topologies (e.g. replicating from ROW based to STATEMENT based,
                from 5.5 to 5.1 etc.)
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Orchestrator</i> can serve in different modes:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Command line interface
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Web API
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Web interface
                    </li>
                </ul>
                 
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Orchestrator</i> is developed at <a href="http://www.outbrain.com">Outbrain</a> to answer for the difficulty 
                in managing replication topologies. At the time of <i>orchestrator</i> creation GTID is available via MySQL 5.6
                and MariaDB 10.0. And yet GTID is still not as mature as one would hope for. The majority of users still
                use plain-old binlog file:position based MySQL replication, and apparently this will hold for some time.
